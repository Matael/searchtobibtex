To install, run as root:

    make install

This will install the scripts to /usr/local/bin and the man files to /usr/share/man. If you want to install somewhere else other than /usr/local (perhaps /opt) you will need to edit the Makefile to change PREFIX. There is no configure script for this project, as yet.

To uninstall you can run (again as root):

    make uninstall

To just install the scripts or man files, bin and man targets are available.

    make clean

removes the build directory.
